      <!-- 1. Agreement to Terms -->
      <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Customer," "you," or "your") and NextBelt LLC, an Arizona limited liability company ("NextBelt," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
      <p>By accessing or using the NextBelt website (<a href="https://next-belt.com">next-belt.com</a>), the Smart Maintenance Management System ("SMMS") platform, or any related services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
      <p>If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity.</p>

      <!-- 2. Description of Services -->
      <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>

      <h3>2.1 SMMS Platform</h3>
      <p>SMMS is a cloud-based, multi-tenant Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work order management</li>
        <li>Asset tracking and maintenance scheduling</li>
        <li>Preventive maintenance automation</li>
        <li>Inventory and parts management</li>
        <li>Mobile workforce management</li>
        <li>Reporting and analytics</li>
        <li>AI-powered maintenance assistant (ELISA)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 ELISA AI Assistant</h3>
      <p>SMMS includes an AI-powered maintenance assistant ("ELISA") that leverages large language models (LLMs) provided by OpenAI. The following terms apply specifically to ELISA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No Training on Customer Data:</strong> NextBelt does <strong>not</strong> use Customer Data to train, fine-tune, or improve any machine-learning model. Prompts and outputs are processed in real-time and are not retained by our AI sub-processor for model training.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Ownership:</strong> AI-generated outputs (e.g., maintenance recommendations, work order drafts) are provided as suggestions only. You retain ownership of any output you choose to save or incorporate into your Customer Data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Warranty on AI Outputs:</strong> ELISA outputs are generated probabilistically and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable for your specific operational context. All AI-generated recommendations should be reviewed and validated by qualified maintenance personnel before implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Transparency:</strong> ELISA uses OpenAI's API services. NextBelt does not have access to or control over the underlying model weights, but we configure system prompts and guardrails to optimize outputs for industrial maintenance contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Bias and Limitations:</strong> AI models may reflect biases present in their training data. NextBelt does not guarantee that AI outputs are free from bias, and you agree not to use ELISA outputs as the sole basis for safety-critical decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Prompts sent to ELISA may include contextual data from your SMMS environment (asset details, work order descriptions). This data is transmitted to OpenAI under our Data Processing Agreement with OpenAI and is subject to <a href="https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy">OpenAI's Enterprise Privacy commitments</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Consulting Services</h3>
      <p>NextBelt also offers maintenance consulting, belt drive analysis, and related professional services, which may be governed by separate statements of work.</p>

      <!-- 3. Account Registration and Security -->
      <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Account Creation</h3>

        <li>Promptly notify us of any unauthorized access</li>
      </ul>

Upon completion, our SOC 2 Type II report will be available to customers upon request under NDA. Our security obligations are further described in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

      <!-- 12. Indemnification -->
      <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>

      <h3>12.1 Customer Indemnification</h3>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NextBelt, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any third-party claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:</p>

      <p>NextBelt will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from any third-party claims alleging that Customer's authorized use of the SMMS platform infringes a third party's United States patent, copyright, or trade secret. NextBelt's obligations under this section are conditioned on Customer: (a) promptly notifying NextBelt of any such claim; (b) granting NextBelt sole control of the defense and settlement; and (c) providing reasonable cooperation.</p>
      <p>If the Services become or, in NextBelt's opinion, are likely to become the subject of an infringement claim, NextBelt may, at its option: (i) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services; (ii) modify the Services to be non-infringing; or (iii) terminate the affected subscription and refund any prepaid fees for the unused portion of the term.</p>

      <!-- 13. Term and Termination -->
      <h2>13. Term and Termination</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure within 30 days of notice</li>
        <li>Becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>13.5 Survival</h3>

      <!-- 14. Dispute Resolution -->
      <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>

      <h3>14.1 Governing Law</h3>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

      <h3>14.2 Arbitration</h3>
      <p>Except for disputes qualifying for small claims court (under $10,000), any dispute arising from these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Phoenix, Arizona, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with experience in commercial software agreements.</p>
      <p><strong>Fee Allocation:</strong> Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs, except that AAA filing fees and arbitrator fees shall be allocated in accordance with the AAA Rules, and the arbitrator may award fees and costs to the prevailing party.</p>

      <h3>14.3 Injunctive Relief</h3>
      <p>Notwithstanding Section 14.2, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights, confidential information, or to enforce the non-solicitation or non-compete provisions of any ancillary agreement, without first resorting to arbitration and without posting a bond.</p>

      <h3>14.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
      <p class="legal-emphasis">TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND NEXTBELT AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

      <!-- 15. General Provisions -->
      <h2>15. General Provisions</h2>

      <h3>15.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
      <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and any Order Forms, constitute the entire agreement between you and NextBelt.</p>

      <h3>15.2 Amendments</h3>
      <p>We may modify these Terms by posting updates on our website. For material changes, we will provide at least 30 days' advance notice via email to your account administrator. Continued use of the Services after the effective date of any change constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to a material change, you may terminate your subscription before the change takes effect.</p>

      <h3>15.3 Waiver</h3>
      <p>Failure to enforce any provision does not waive our right to enforce it later.</p>

      <h3>15.4 Severability</h3>
      <p>If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>

      <h3>15.5 Assignment</h3>
      <p>You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign to an affiliate or successor.</p>

      <h3>15.6 Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>Neither party is liable for failure or delay in performing its obligations (other than payment obligations) to the extent caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: acts of God, natural disasters, pandemic, epidemic, fire, flood, earthquake, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, government actions or orders, utility or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, or third-party service provider outages. The affected party shall provide prompt notice and use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact. If a force majeure event continues for more than 60 consecutive days, either party may terminate the affected Order Form upon written notice.</p>
